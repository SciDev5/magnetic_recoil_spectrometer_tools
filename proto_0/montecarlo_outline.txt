ok so i need it to be able to accept as input cross section for several types of interaction and stopping power data for the charged products and return a distribution of output energies and angles for electrons scattered by a gamma beam entering perpendicular to the surface with given energy.


trace(n_rays:int, phot_energy:float, foil:Foil) -> (elec_energy:array_1d, elec_angle:array_1d)


/// represents the conversion foil's properties and contains simulation parameters
Foil:
    srxm:SRXMData
    cross_sections:CrossSection


/// Stopping and Range of X in Matter, where X is electrons, or ions
SRXMData:
    [data table in [J / m] (usually from [MeV g/cm2])]
    attenuate_rays(elec_energy:array_1d, elec_depth:array_1d) -> (elec_energy:array_1d)


/// Thing that calculates the scattering cross-sections.
CrossSection:
    gen_rays(n_rays:int, phot_energy:float) -> (elec_energy:array_1d, elec_angle:array_1d)
    cross_section_density_total(phot_energy:float) -> (cross_section_density:float)
